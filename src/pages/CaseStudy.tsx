  overview:
    "Bakery Faize Nagina wanted to expand its business through a modern digital platform that would allow customers to browse products, place orders, choose between pickup or delivery, and complete secure online payments. The goal was to create a seamless mobile experience while simplifying order management for the bakery staff. To achieve this, a complete mobile application was developed for both Android and iOS, supported by a scalable backend and an intuitive admin management system.",

  challenge:
    "The bakery relied heavily on traditional order-taking methods, making it difficult to efficiently manage customer orders, inventory, and menu updates. Customers lacked a convenient way to order online, while the bakery team needed a centralized system to track orders, update products, and monitor inventory in real time. Ensuring inventory accuracy and preventing customers from ordering unavailable products was one of the key technical challenges.",

  solution:
    "A complete bakery management and ordering platform was developed using Flutter for cross-platform mobile support. The application allows customers to browse bakery items, add products to their cart, place orders for pickup or delivery, and complete transactions through secure payment gateways. A robust backend was implemented to manage products, users, orders, and inventory. Real-time inventory synchronization ensures that unavailable items cannot be purchased, while push notifications keep customers informed about order updates. An administrative dashboard enables bakery staff to manage products, pricing, inventory, and incoming orders efficiently.",
